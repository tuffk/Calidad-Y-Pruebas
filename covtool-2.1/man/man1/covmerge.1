NAME

  covmerge.exe -- merged coverage info from multiple test runs

SYNOPSIS

  covmerge.exe *.covexp >merged.db


DESCRIPTION

  This script merges test coverage information produced by
  instrumented executables into a single database file.  You
  typically run many instrumented programs many times each
  to get the collection of .covexp files.  You then merge
  these many files into a single merged.db file for later
  processing.

  The merging process includes the creation of new
  information.  The instrumented programs do not aggregate
  the information on a directory basis.  covmerge.exe does
  this for you.

  You can examine the merged.db file yourself, but the
  easies way is to use the gen_html script to have it
  create web pages which you can then just peruse.
