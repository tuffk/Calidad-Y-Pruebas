This directory shows an example of building a trivial program
and running its tests to get coverage instrumentaton.

If you run 'make' in this directory, when it has just been
cleaned, you will build without instrumentation.  There are
no tests of interest when you build in this mode.

If you want to build for instrumentation, do this:

  make clean
  make INSTRUMENTATION=1
  make INSTRUMENTATION=1 tests

At the completion of this run, you will have

    1.ann  a copy of program.c annotated to show lines covered in test 1
    2.ann  ditto for test 2
    3.ann  ditto for test 3
    4.ann  a combined annotation for tests 1, 2, and 3

You will also have merged.db a numerical listing of lines
instrumented and executed, etc.

The test runs simply invoke 'program' with 0, then 1, then 2 parameters
and the program goes through different paths based thereon.  These
paths can be seen the .ann files.
