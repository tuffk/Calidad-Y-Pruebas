NAME

    covtool -- tools for analyzing test coverage

SYNOPSIS

    cov++
    covmerge.exe
    gen_html
    covannotate.exe
    covtool.exe

DESCRIPTION

    The suite of covtool programs lets you dynamically
    instrument C++ programs as you compile them.  When
    instrumented programs run, they automatically generate
    test coverage information.  This coverage information
    can then be used to help you improve the quality of
    your code by adding new tests that verify every line
    of your program's behavior.

    The other executables and scripts, described above have
    their own man pages.  The covtool.exe program is
    described here.

    The program, covtool.exe, instruments your C++ code by
    recognizing the major program components:

      statements
      functions
      classes
      class members
      typedef, union, enum, etc
      namespaces

    It then injects function calls into your program which
    log the fact that lines within files have been executed.
    As your program runs, a database of this information is
    kept.  At program termination, this database is printed
    to a log file.  These log files are then merged together
    and converted into annotated source (ascii or html
    format).
