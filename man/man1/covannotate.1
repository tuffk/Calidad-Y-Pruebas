NAME

    covannotate.exe -- annotate c++ source given coverage info

SYNOPSIS

    covannotate.exe source_file merged.db

DESCRIPTION

  This program reads the coverage information, either in
  merged or .covexp format, and uses it to annotate C++
  source files to show which lines were executed and
  which weren't.  Here is an example of its output:

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
   +{
   +  printf("hello world");
   +  exit(0);
     }

  In general, you should use gen_html to automate the process
  of annotating all your files for you.
